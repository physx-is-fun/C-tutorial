# Data types

Data types: Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The types in C can be classified as follows:
    
    Basic types: They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: 
        (a) integer types
        (b) floating-point types
    Enumerated types (They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.)
    The type void (The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.)
    Derived types:
        (a) Pointer types, 
        (b) Array types, 
        (c) Structure types, 
        (d) Union types and 
        (e) Function types
    The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value.
    
    char (1 byte; −128 to 127)
    signed char (1 byte; −128 to 127)
    unsigned char (1 byte; 0 to 255)
    short (2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    signed short (2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    unsigned short (2 byte; 0 to 65,535)
    int (2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    signed int (2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    unsigned int (2 byte; 0 to 65,535)
    short int (2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    signed short int ( 2 byte; −32,768 to 32,767)
    unsigned short int (2 byte; 0 to 65,535)
    long int (4 byte; -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
    signed long int (4 byte; -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
    unsigned long int (4 byte; 0 to 4,294,967,295)
    float (4 byte; 1.17549e-38 to 3.40282e+38)
    double (8 byte; 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e+308)
    long double (10 byte; 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e+308)

% format specifier: Defines and formats a type of data to be displayed.
