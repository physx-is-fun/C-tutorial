# Decision making

## Decision making 

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false. C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value. C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.

    if statement (An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.)
    if...else statement (An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.)
    nested if statements (You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).)
    switch statement (A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.)
    nested switch statements (You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).)
