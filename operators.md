# Operators

Operators: An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:
    * Arithmetic Operators
    * Relational Operators
    * Logical Operators
    * Bitwise Operators
    * Assignment Operators
    * Misc Operators

Arithmetic operators: An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables).
    + (Adds two operands.)
    - (Subtracts second operand from the first.)
    * (Multiplies both operands.)
    / (Divides numerator by de-numerator.)
    % (Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer)
    ++ (Increment operator increases the integer value by one.)
    -- (Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.)

Relational operators: A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.
    == (Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.)
    > (Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.)
    < (Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.)
    != (Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.)
    >= (Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.)
    <= (Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.) 

Bitwise operators: During computation, mathematical operations like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level which makes processing faster and saves power.
    & (Bitwise AND)
    | (Bitwise OR)
    ^ (Bitwise exclusive OR)
    ~ (Bitwise complement)
    << (Shift left)
    >> (Shift right)

Assigment operators: Used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and assigns the result back to the same variable. Examlple: x = x + 1; => x + = 1;
